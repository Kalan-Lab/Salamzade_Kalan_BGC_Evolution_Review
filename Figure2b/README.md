## Notes

- lsaBGC-Pan was largely run using v1.0.9 but lsaBGC-Sociate was rerun using v1.1.1 to reflect more recent updates to make the module more conservative in reporting of associated traits with focal GCFs (final chosen focal GCF was GCF_13.pdf).
- Input for lsaBGC-Pan was run with antiSMASH (v7.0.0) BGC predictions for 156 Streptomyces albidoflavus genomes (see Genome_Listing.txt). 
- The lsaBGC-Sociate results were extracted for inclusion in this Git repo, but the protein sequences and alignments of associated traits with focal GCFs and such were large and excluded - because we do not dive into details in the review.
